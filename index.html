			<font size= "4" color="#000000">Last summer, I had a trip with my friends from junior high.<br> We haven't met each other for a long time, so we decided to travel together by ourselves.

		<font size= "4" color="#000000">There were many reasons why my friends and I wanted to have a vacation by our own. One of the reasons was that we thought it would be very interesting if we could do everything by ourselves, <br>including planning schedule and booking hostel. We also wanted to be more independent and have new experience about what we have not done.</p>
		
		<p><font size= "4" color="#000000"> We went to many places during that week, and these were some of my favorite places during the vacation.</font></p>
		<p><font size= "4" color="#000000"> This picture was took in Taipei. It is like a night market but it is not. There are many shops and most of them are selling clothes and cuisines. For the place we took this picture, there were many similar walls that were drawn by artists. We thought the pictures were very cool so we decided to take a picture.</font></p>

		<p><font size= "4" color="#000000"> This beach was also in Taipei. It was a sunny day so all of us sweat a lot. But we still have a lot of fun for playing sand and ocean.</font></p>

		<p><font size= "4" color="#000000"> We also went to Ali Mountain, which is in Chaiyi. That day was a superb tired day, we climbed thousands of stairs to reach and woke up very early just for watching the sunrise. However, it was worth that we been through these hard-work. The sunrise was very beautiful and shiny, all of us not only took the picture of it but also kept the image in our minds.</font></p>

		<p><font size= "4" color="#000000"> "Si Zhi Wan" is in Kaoshung. We went their just for watching the sunset. When we got there, there were already lots of people standing beside on the bridge waiting for the sunset. For me, I prefer sunset compare to sunrise because sunset is more romantic and also very magnificant.</font></p>

		<p><font size= "4" color="#000000"> I remembered that one night, we decided to climb a mountain for night view. So, we choose the nearest mountain, which is "XianShan". Although we did not reach the top because there were too many stairs, we still got to the middle of the mountain and enjoyed the view.</font></p>

		<p><font size= "4" color="#000000"> We also went to Yilan for the Yilan International Children Folklore & Folkgame Festival. This is a water festival where there are many rides for people to play. We have a lot of fun there and also enjoyed our time.</font></p>
